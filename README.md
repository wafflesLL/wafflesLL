## 💻 My Personal Interests

- I am an avid gym lover, and go to work out 3-4 times a week (it would be higher volume but I am in school)
- I also love a VIM workflow programming. Sometimes it is easier to work out of Visual Studio Code, but I still use the VIM motions in VS Code and even use the Vimium Extension in my browser since switching between a code space and using browser tabs can often be difficult workspace transitions i prefer to use the same movement accross my entire workflow. My neovim configuration is available [here](https://github.com/wafflesLL/nvim) I do not update it as often as I used to but since I use it so often, it should be updated to work with the latest dependencies within a few days of updates
- I also enjoy hiking and though I have not been able to do as much during my time in college, I still want to do at least one trip a year in order to fully disconnect from the rapid pace world we all live in just for a little bit.
